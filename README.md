### The Expectation-maximization algorithm

This project entails the how and the why of the expectation-maximization algorithm. 

Clustering algorithms play an important role in understanding data. Grasp relationships and detect similarities among thousands of records in a dataset is a burdensome task. Fortunately, numerous algorithms come to aid in these matters. Generally, such algorithms make different assumptions about the underlying probabilistic generative process of the data.

Expectation maximization is an iterative algorithm that maximizes the maximum likelihood estimation of data in the presence of latent variables.
