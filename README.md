### The Expectation-maximization algorithm

This project entails the how and the why of the expectation-maximization algorithm used in the context of gaussian data. 

Clustering algorithms play an important role in understanding data. Grasp relationships and detect similarities among thousands of records in a dataset is a burdensome task. Fortunately, numerous algorithms come to aid in these matters. Generally, such algorithms make different assumptions about the underlying probabilistic generative process of the data.

The E-M algorithm maximizes the likelihood of data assuming a certain number distributions with different means and covariance matrices. GMM can be used for generative unsupervised learning or clustering. 

The E-M algorithm is able to fit data to distributions as in the images below.
